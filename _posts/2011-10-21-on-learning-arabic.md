suggest one should learn a new language every year: it broadens your thinking.
And it does. Few experiences in the past couple of years have been as
mind-bending for me as learning [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) and
[CLIPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_%28programming_language%29). Of
course, the Pragmatic Programmers were talking about programming languages, but
I see no reason why this shouldn't apply to natural languages as well.

So I recently decided to pick up Arabic. You might ask why, and if you did, you
would be asking a pretty valid question. For starters, I already know French
and Spanish, so Italian wouldn't really broaden my thinking anymore. I wanted
something different. Something really different. Of course I could have chosen
Mandarin Chinese, but China is sooo far away. I could have chosen Klingon,
which would have allowed me to make a clever pun on the
[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity),
but what would be the point? Arabic seemed to fit the bill quite nicely,
though. It is relevant to today's world, albeit sensitive politically (and no,
[me growing a beard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJFBqh6cVc) is completely
unrelated!) and boy, is it different. I've had to discard everything I knew
about writing, and start over completely.

In the remainder of this post, I'll highlight some of Arabic's awesome
properties that make it such a different language. And also: so difficult to
learn. I'll do it in a top ten list, because top ten lists are so populair in
teh blogoshperez nowadays. Small disclaimer: everything I say may be false. I
only just started learning!

1. Last week, in my fifth lesson, I finally learned how to write my name: يان .
   Awesome. We still haven't learned all of the alphabet yet, though.

2. Every Arabic word starts with a consonant, even the ones that start with a
   vowel. This is because in Arabic, the glottal stop is a proper consonant. If
   you don't know what a glottal stop is: it's the sound between _uh_ and _oh_
   in _uh-oh_. It's the sound that the French try so hard to avoid: they say
   _l'ann&eacute;e_ instead of _la ann&eacute;e_ and _le nouvel an_ instead of
   _le nouveau an_ so the vowels won't clash. Even English is guilty of this,
   by te way: _a apple_ just plain sounds weird.

2. _Alif_ is the simplest letter, and also the hardest: ا . See? Simple. But
   it's not the _a_, although sometimes it is. It's also not the glottal stop,
   although sometimes it is. Sometimes it's even an _i_, and it can be other
   things as well. I still haven't figured out when it's what, despite my
   teacher's insistence that it's totally easy.

3. Vowels in Arabic aren't vowels: they're movements. They modify the consonant
   that they follow, and they are written as a diacritic on that consonant.
   Take for example the letter b: ب . _ba_ becomes بَ , _bo_ becomes بُ , and
   _bi_ is بِ . (I really hope this renders correctly on your screen! You may
   want to increase the font size.) But here is the mind-bender: "no vowel" is
   also a movement. ب doesn't exist; _b_ is بْ , and there is no no spoon.

4. Movements are extremely important in Arabic. They determine if a noun is the
   subject or the object in a sentence. They determine the tense of a verb. In
   fact, they determine whether a word is [a noun or a
   verb](http://www.sharingmachine.com/prodimages/nouns-200.gif) in the first
   place. But they're not written. Oh no. Forget about بَ , بُ , and بِ . There's
   only ب . Context will have to determine the movements, and therefore the
   meaning of the word. (The key exception is, of course, the Quran, because
   Allah's words are immutable and should therefore not be open to
   interpretation. Also, children's books are an exception.)

5. If you want a long vowel sound, you just add a consonant. Normally, و is
   _w_, ي is _y_, and ا is whatever the hell it is. But _baa_ is بَا , _boo_ is
   بُو , _bii_ is بِي , and the consonants lose their proper sound. Kind of like
   _oa_ is a longer _o_ in English. (Note also how the ب becomes a lot shorter
   when it's at the beginning, i.e. the right side, of a word. Just look for
   the upwards-pointing squiggle with the dot below it.) But, obviously, the
   movement isn't written, so it's up to you, and your ability to deduce
   context, to find out whether و in بو is a long _o_ sound, or simply a _w_.
   Good luck!

6. _A_ and _e_ are the same sound. Also, there's no _p_. To compensate, there
   are two _h_'s, two _d_'s, two _s_'s, two _r_'s and two _k_'s. Don't confuse
   them, because they sound as different to Arabs as the _a_ and _e_ do to us.
   Turns out that Klingon has a lot of these sounds as well, so I'm already
   reasonably familiar with these sounds. ...Wait, did I just admit to knowing
   Klingon? Crap. Can I still take this back?

7. You probably already knew that in Arabic, a letter changes shape depending
   on its position in a word. A letter can have up to four distinct shapes.
   But, did you also know that the ت has two distinct end-of-word forms, one of
   which is used only in feminine words? I'm not making this up.

8. So, returning to my name: يان. It's three letters: _ya_ ي, _alif_ ا, and
   _na_ ن. But isn't that a terribly naïve transliteration? In fact, isn't
   it _wrong_? Arabic doesn't write vowels, and even if it did, only a n00b
   would think that _alif_ is the _a_. So, shouldn't it be ين (or, properly
   vocalized: يَن)? Well, no, because that would look ugly in Arabic. According
   to my teacher anyway. Apparently, short vowels in European loanwords become
   long in Arabic. So, as I said before, to make an _a_ long, throw in an ا.
   Hence: يان. Once more, with movement: يَان.

9. The letter _ta_ is also a smiley ت.

All this after only five lessons, and we didn't even do all of the  alphabet
yet. I can't wait to learn more about this fascinating  language. I may have to
write some more about it in a later post.
