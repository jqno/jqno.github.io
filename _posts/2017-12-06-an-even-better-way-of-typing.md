Four years ago I wrote about [a better way of typing]({% post_url 2013-10-12-a-better-way-of-typing %}) with a _compose key_. If you don't know what that means, please read the story now. It'll blow your mind. Seriously. Don't worry, I'll wait until you're done reading.

At the end, I describe a way to get compose key functionality on OS X, by installing a new keyboard layout. It's the method I've been using all this time. However, the keyboard layout has some weird quirks that have become increasingly annoying to me. It often changes the font for some reason, and I'm not sure exactly what kind of unicode it generates, because it sometimes gives me trouble when I use accented letters in filenames. So I've been looking for a replacement, and I'm very happy to say that I've found one.

It involves installing [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). You'll also need the powerpack, which unfortunately isn't free. Then you can install the [snippet collection](http://jqno.nl/ComposeKey.alfredsnippets/) I've created (which _is_ free), and you're good to go!

Enjoy a better way of typing! â˜º
