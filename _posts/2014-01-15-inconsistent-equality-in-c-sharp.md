Remember last month, when I was [comparing ints with shorts in C#]({% post_url 2013-12-15-comparing-ints-and-shorts-in-c-sharp %})? I found a symmetry issue, and decided to ask [Eric Lippert](http://ericlippert.com/) about it because, well, why not?

And I actually received a reply. A very thorough one at that. He's posted it on Coverity's blog, as part of their recurring "Ask The Bug Guys" series of posts. [It's an interesting read!](http://blog.coverity.com/2014/01/13/inconsistent-equality)
