Hi there! I'm Jan Ouwens, a software developer from the Netherlands. You might know me from my [EqualsVerifier](/equalsverifier) project, which is a Java tool that you can use to test whether you've implemented `equals` correctly.

Currently, I'm a Scala developer at [Ordina](http://www.ordina.nl). Before that, I've used Java to play with trains at [NS](http://www.ns.nl) for [Sogeti](http://www.sogeti.nl), I've used C# to write specialized apps to operate an electron microscope at [Sioux](http://www.sioux.eu), done some super-secret logic programming stuff at Philips, and I've written a big web app in Java for [TOPdesk](http://www.topdesk.com). In my free time, I like to dabble in Scala and Android, among other things. [Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Jan+Ouwens)'s my app!

When I'm not coding (or doing other things), I like to write, usually in Dutch. See for example my old blog [Brief en leed](http://www.jqno.nl/briefenleed), my [Master's thesis on wireless video streaming](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/367016/jqno.nl/thesis.pdf) or my [way too in-depth survey of Asterix jokes](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/367016/jqno.nl/paper.pdf). Oh, and this blog, obviously.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/janouwens), [GitHub](http://github.com/jqno), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/127863/jqno), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jqno), [Delicious](https://delicious.com/jqno), and [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/jqno).

Speaking of Last.fm: here's [a list of all the concerts that I've been to since 1999](http://www.jqno.nl/concerts).
