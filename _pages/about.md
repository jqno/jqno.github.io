Hi there! I'm Jan Ouwens, a software developer from the Netherlands. You might know me from my [EqualsVerifier](http://jqno.nl/equalsverifier) project, or from the [talks](/speaking) I sometimes give.

I have worked in many different domains: banking, train operations, image processing for electron microscopes, and ITIL process management, to name just a few. I try to be a polyglot, so I have worked with various different languages such as Java, C#, Typescript, Delphi, Ruby, Jess (a Prolog-like language with a Lisp-like syntax), and yes, even VBScript. Currently I'm working mostly in Scala. Like any self-respecting nerd, I also [have an app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Jan+Ouwens)!

When I'm not coding (or doing other things), I like to write, usually in Dutch. See for example my old blog [Brief en leed](http://www.jqno.nl/briefenleed), my [Master's thesis on wireless video streaming](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/367016/jqno.nl/thesis.pdf) or my [way too in-depth survey of Asterix jokes](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/367016/jqno.nl/paper.pdf). Oh, and this blog, obviously.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/janouwens), [GitHub](http://github.com/jqno), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/127863/jqno), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jqno), [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:jqno), and [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/jqno). Speaking of Last.fm: here's [a list of all the concerts that I've been to since 1999](http://jqno.nl/concerts).
