Privacy is important and I try to be careful with yours. In the mean time, I want to know how many of you there are, and where you're coming from. That's why there's a Google Analytics cookie on this site.

Since Google knows enough about you already, I try to minimize the amount of information I share with them through this cookie. That's why I did the following things:

* I unchecked all the boxes I could. This includes: "Google products & services", "Benchmarking", "Technical support", "Account specialists", and especially "Google sales experts".
* I only share partial IP addresses with Google through their `anonymizeIp` feature.
* I enabled the `forceSSL` feature to make sure your data is encrypted before it's sent to Google.
* I have agreed to the Data Processing Amendment, although I'm not sure if that has any practical effect.

If you have any further suggestions, please let me know. You can find ways to contact me in the sidebar.
